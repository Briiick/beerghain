# Beerghain

We are the future of subscriptions.

Web 3.0 has empowered new financial flows of capital via technologies such as Superfluid. This has unlocked a lot of potential for new ways of providing enhanced liquidity, customizability, and other features for payment systems.

Beerghain connects Web 2 companies with Web 3 subscriptions. And we provide insurance on defaults if things go wrong.

Imagine the use-case:

- You are a business and want to be paid a premium for your services. You don’t care about getting paid up front as much as you care about making more money & having more customers.
- So, you use Beerghain. This allows you to:
    - a) get paid at a premium via Superfluid; and
    - b) pay an insurance premium that is less than the difference between the premium you pay and the web2 solution to cover your ass.
- So, at the end of the day you get paid more. And there’s no worries, because if the consumer defaults on subscription payment, you’re covered by the liquidity insurance pool.
- And the incentive for the consumer for paying at a premium is that they have increased flexibility. Defaulting doesn’t fuck the business, because they are insured and you’re paying a premium for it. You also have increased liquidity because you aren’t paying all money up front.

This creates a unique flywheel that accelerates growth for businesses while keeping customers happy and both parties protected.
